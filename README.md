# Argent Bank Full Stack Application

## Overview

This repository holds the full-stack application for Argent Bank, a fictional banking platform. It includes both the back-end API and the front-end interface built with React.

## Project Structure

- `/back`: Contains the Node.js backend application, connecting to MongoDB Atlas.
- `/front`: Contains the React front-end application.

## Back-End Setup

Refer to the README in the `back` directory for instructions on setting up and running the back-end part of the project, including environment configuration and database setup.

## Front-End Setup

The front-end application was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). For detailed instructions on available scripts and development setup, refer to the README in the `front` directory.

### Quick Start

Within the `front` directory, you can run several commands:

```bash
npm start       # Starts the app in development mode at http://localhost:3000
npm test        # Launches the test runner
npm run build   # Builds the app for production
```

## Getting Started

To get started with the full-stack application:

1. Ensure you have Node.js installed for the back-end and a modern browser for the front-end.
2. Follow the back-end setup instructions in `/back/README.md`.
